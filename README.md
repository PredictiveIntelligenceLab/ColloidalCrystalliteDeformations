## Abstract
Displacive transformations in colloidal crystals may offer a new pathway for increasing the
diversity of accessible configurations without the need to engineer particle shape or interaction
complexity. To date, binary crystals comprised of spherically symmetric particles at specific size
ratios have been formed that exhibit floppiness and facile routes for transformation into more rigid
structures that are otherwise not accessible by direct nucleation and growth. There is evidence
that such transformations, at least at the micron-scale, are kinetically influenced by concomitant
solvent motion that effectively induces hydrodynamic correlations between particles. Here, we
study quantitatively the impact of such interactions on the transformation of binary bcc-CsCl
analogue crystals into close-packed configurations. We first employ Principal Component
Analysis to stratify the explorations of a bcc-CsCl crystallite into orthogonal directions according
to displacement. We then compute diffusion coefficients along the different directions using
several dynamical models and find that hydrodynamic correlations, depending on their range, can
either enhance or dampen collective particle motions. These two distinct effects work
synergistically to bias crystallite deformations towards a subset of the available outcomes.
